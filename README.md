# WBEC-HEMS

This is the starting point to create a local HEMS for multiple [Heidelberg Energy Control](https://wallbox.heidelberg.com) Wallboxes.
I'm currently developing it using a RaspberryPI Model 3 and the [RS485 and CAN Module](https://www.inno-maker.com/product/rs485-and-can-module/)
by Innomaker to connect to the Modbus Interfaces of the Wallboxes.
The project was inspired the [WBEC](https://github.com/steff393/wbec) Project by Steff393 but I wanted to use an isolated RS485 circuit
and a RaspberryPI.
